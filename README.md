# Notify – Firebase FCM with TDD Clean Architecture + BLoC

This app is scaffolded to demonstrate a minimal Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) setup using Clean Architecture and BLoC with tests.

## Structure

- lib/core/firebase/firebase_bootstrap.dart – Firebase init and permission.
- lib/firebase_options.dart – Placeholder. Replace with file generated by FlutterFire.
- feature/notifications/
  - domain: entities, repositories, use cases.
  - data: FCM data source and repository implementation.
  - presentation: BLoC and page to display messages and token.

## Setup steps

1) Install Firebase CLI and FlutterFire CLI (one time):
	- npm i -g firebase-tools
	- dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli

2) Login and configure your Firebase project:
	- firebase login
	- flutterfire configure --project <your-project-id>
	This generates lib/firebase_options.dart and adds platform configs (google-services.json / GoogleService-Info.plist).

3) Android specific:
	- Ensure google-services.json is under android/app/.
	- Android 13+ requires POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission (already added in manifest).

4) iOS specific:
	- Place GoogleService-Info.plist under ios/Runner/.
	- In Xcode, enable Push Notifications and Background Modes > Remote notifications.

5) Run tests:
	- flutter test

6) Run the app:
	- flutter run

## Using the sample

- The home screen shows a list of received foreground messages.
- Tap the key icon to fetch and display your FCM token.

Replace the placeholder firebase_options.dart with the generated file for your Firebase project before running on devices.
